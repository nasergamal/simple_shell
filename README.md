# Simple shell
## Intro
This is a project assigned to us by the ALX software engineering program. The objective for this project is to teach collaboration and create our own simple shell.

## Description
The program we have written to create our own simple shell works well. Our shell is able to generate a prompt and wait for user input. It is able to execute functions either by full path or app name. It has the capability to execute builtin commands like cd, exit or set/unsetenv. This shell we have created can also handle the commands separator `;`.  Our shell is also able to handle shell logical operators `&&` and `||`. It handles the `$?` variable and the `$$` variable. It handles comment with use of (#) character.
