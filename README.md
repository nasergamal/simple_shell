# Simple shell
## Intro
This is a project assigned to us by the ALX software engineering program. The objectives for this project is to teach collaboration and create our own simple shell. So basically our implementation of a simple shell should be closely similar to the already exiting shells.

## Description
The program we have written to create our own simple shell works well. Our shell is able to generate a prompt `($) ` and wait for user input. It is able to execute functions either by full path or app name. It has the capability to execute builtin commands like `cd`, `exit` or `set/unsetenv`. This shell we have created can also handle the commands separator `;`.  Our shell is also able to handle shell logical operators `&&` and `||`. It handles the `$?` variable and the `$$` variable. It handles comment with use of the `#` character. Though the program has some bugs I believe that it is a great program. This shell implementation does not execute the alias command.
